Waterfall vs Agile vs Agile with DevOps

Yearly Health checks -> DEC 2026, max 50% chances -> Waterfall
Monthly Health checks -> 80% chances to prevent -> Agile
Apple watch -> DevOps -> Continous feedback

Stakeholders -> Who is part of the system

School -> Parents, Students, teachers, management, non teaching staff, investors, Government

Project -> RBI, Government, Banking management, investors, bod, developers, testing, admin, devops and cloud, Support, reports, monitoring, etc.

50 years back model
=========
Final Exam

Parents -> Daily worry
Teachers -> 3 months
Students -> 60 days before

30-40% pass percentage


Process change -> Unit tests -> I, II, III, IV, V, Quarterly, half yearly, pre-final, final

1 month
========
unit test - I
teachers -> must complete syllabus
students -> 1 week before

result -> 30% pass
parents -> 

unit test - II
=========
teachers -> must complete syllabus
students -> 2 weeks before

result -> 40% pass
parents teachers meeting
||

||
final
80-90% pass percentage

daily slip tests
200 exams -> 200 feedbacks
student -> DAY-1

99.9% pass

if you test a system 1 time, you get 10 defects
if you test a system 100 times, you get aleast 11 defects

DEV, QA, SIT, UAT, PERF, PRE-PROD, PROD

formula -> test the drink -> DEV
employees -> taste the drink, take feedback -> QA
friends and family members -> take feedback -> SIT
random group -> take feedback -> UAT

Fassai -> take certification -> Client approval

release to public market -> PROD

Waterfall
==========
3 years -> 30cr
clients
tech team -> 
6 months, 7 months
development
testing -> free, operations, build and release

testing -> 100 defects
developers -> free

100 defects -> analyse 40 invalid defects
working in DEV not working in PROD
ambassdor


Agile
========
modules -> user, cart, catalogue, shipping, payment, order management, reviews, delivery, etc..

sprints -> 1 month
user -> login,signup, forgot password, otps...
1 month

15 days development, 15 days deployment and testing

developers -> from DAY-1
testing -> day -> 10

10 defects -> 3 invalid defects
end of the month -> show something

2 defects

sprint-II
=========
2 defects backlog
catalogue module completion
DM, CSM -> what you did yesterday, what are you doing today, anything blocking you

Digital revolution/transformation
=================================
Daily tests

enter your first name -> 
enter your last name ->

success test cases -> right inputs, result fail -> failure
failure test cases -> failure input, result succes -> failure

+ve, -ve test cases
10 test cases -> less chances for invalid defects, 2 invalid defects
productivitiy, co-ordination, cooperation

build errors
functionality/development errors
deployment errors

IDBI -> 5% market share
100cr revenue
invest some amount on technology, reduce cost by moving from waterfall to devops, cloud


DevOps is the process of  building, deploying and testing the applications continuosly. basically if we can deploy and test the code on the same day we can get maximum feedback cycles to improve our product...
Ofcourse we use multiple tools to make this process smooth. continuos development, integration, deployment, delivery, testing, monitoring, application security etc part of devops

15th JULY -> AWS free tier is different
6 months -> 100$ credits + 100$ credits

debit and credit
international transformations enable -> netbanking, online spending, etc.
	SBI, Rupay try to avoid.. 
	call to customer care
use bank address while creating account
