Mobile vs Laptop vs Desktop vs Server == Washing Machine == AC == Computer

CPU
RAM
ROM ======> IP Enabled device
OS
Processor

Windows vs Mac vs Linux
========================
Secure -> SSH
No graphics
	Low power
	Low bandwidth
	Low ram
	fast
heavy performance
free
run for years no need of restart
anti virus not required
opensource

hardware and software are tightly coupled

Authentication mechanisms
========================
1. what you can remember
2. RSA Tokens, OTP, Authenticators -> What you have
3. What you are -> fingerprints, retina, palm, etc...

Public Key and Private Key Mechanism
=================================
SSH Keys
box == server == node

ssh-keygen -f daws-88s

-> public key
-> private key

ssh-keygen -f daws-88s
-> private key

Firewall
==========
incoming traffic -> inbound -> don't trust anyone
outgoing traffic -> outbound -> allow everyone to exit

NASA, DRDO -> check outbound traffic too

AWS accounts
=============
1. credit/debit cards
2. international transactions enable
3. same address as in bank
4. PAN card mandatory
5. try to use same first name and lastname

6months -> 100$, 100$
18000 INR

Auto-pay enable by default, disable it in UPI

Regions and Zones
=================
Hyderabad -> Zones east, west, north and south -> atleast 2 

Regions and Availability Zones(AZ)

us-east-1 -> N.Virgina

192.165.89.1
0.0.0.0/0 -> every IP in the internet

compute or storage

protocol -> set of rules

http vs SSH(only employees)

git bash == SSH client == mini linux

C:\Users\siva -> back slash windows
/c/Users/siva -> linux format -> pwd

pwd -> present working directory

ssh-keygen -f daws-88s

Windows -> Hello == hello ==> case insensitive
Linux -> Hello != hello ==> case sensitive

ls -l -> files listing

54.80.53.154

ssh -i <private-key> user-name@IP

which protocol? which port? which server? username and pasword

http -> 80
https -> 443

SSH -> 22

ec2-user

ssh -i daws-88s ec2-user@54.80.53.154

AWS account creation
client server architecture
ssh keys create
firewall create
ec2 instance launch
connect
